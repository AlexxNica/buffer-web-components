## Guideline to updating the changelog

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) to record updates to our changelog:

> Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

>- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
